PROJECT NAME:JOMALIG BEACH WEBSITE

    This project contains the place of jomalig in quezon. We want other people to know how incredible jomalig was, not many people know this island is, so we want to create this type of website to notice and to love this unknown beautiful place here in the Philippines.

    Travel is generally a pleasurable experience. It is a kind of activity, which almost all the people love.it is the best way to have fun and to enjoy with our friends  and families. The beach is just an amazing place to be, just listening to the sound of the waves, feeling the cool breeze across our face and our feet emerging into the sand makes us feel so relaxed, peaceful and completely free as though they are in a magical place so calm and beautiful. It's JOMALIG BEACH.
